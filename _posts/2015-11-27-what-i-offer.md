description: "I bring my storytelling and spiritual guidance to groups, such as synagogues, churches, study groups, or community organizations. I've led workshops on storytelling for service organizations, instructive storytelling on the Ba'al Shem Tov for Tikkun Leil Shavuot (the all-night study holiday), and interfaith dialogues with churches and mosques."
